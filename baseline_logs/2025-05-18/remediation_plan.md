# System Remediation Plan for phx-hypervisor26

## Summary
This document outlines the remediation actions taken on the HPE DL360 Gen10 hypervisor (phx-hypervisor26) to address system issues and improve configuration.

## Remediation Tasks

### ☑ Networkd-wait-online Service
- **Issue**: `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` timing out during boot
- **Action**: Created systemd override to reduce timeout from default to 30 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **File**: `/etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d/override.conf`

### ☑ ZFS Export Errors
- **Issue**: ZFS share service failing with lock errors
- **Action**: Created missing exports directory and files
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Note**: ZFS sharing services kept enabled as ZFS pool 'bulk' exists and may need sharing

### ☑ Passwordless Sudo Configuration
- **Issue**: Password prompts occurring during automation
- **Action**: Added sudoers config to allow passwordless execution of `hpasmcli` and `dmidecode`
- **Status**: ✅ Configured
- **File**: `/etc/sudoers.d/99-cluster-baseline`

### ☑ K3s Presence Check
- **Issue**: Needed to verify if K3s is installed and properly configured
- **Action**: Added detection code to enable K3s if present or skip otherwise
- **Status**: ✅ Configured (not currently installed)

### ☑ Restic Backup Validation
- **Issue**: Need to ensure backups are restorable
- **Action**: Added test restore capability with safety measures
- **Status**: ⚠ Configured but requires RESTIC_REPO environment variable to be set

### ☑ Firmware & Driver Currency
- **Issue**: Need to verify system firmware and drivers are current
- **Action**: Added checks for BIOS via dmidecode and NVIDIA driver version
- **Status**: ⚠ NVIDIA driver version 550.144.03 detected (555-series recommended)
- **Note**: Manual firmware check with HPE support still required

### ☑ Monitoring Integration
- **Issue**: System needs to be added to Prometheus monitoring
- **Action**: Created Prometheus Node Exporter configuration for this server
- **Status**: ⚠ Config created but Prometheus not installed/detected

### ☑ Recurring Baseline Schedule
- **Issue**: Need automated recurring baseline checks
- **Action**: Created systemd timer and service for monthly execution
- **Status**: ✅ Configured for monthly execution
- **File**: `/etc/systemd/system/baseline.timer` and `/etc/systemd/system/baseline.service`

## Remaining Warnings

1. ⚠ **NVIDIA Driver**: Current driver (550.144.03) should be updated to 555-series
2. ⚠ **Restic Backup**: RESTIC_REPO environment variable not set
3. ⚠ **Prometheus**: Monitoring configuration created but no Prometheus installation detected
4. ⚠ **BIOS**: Manual verification against HPE latest firmware required
